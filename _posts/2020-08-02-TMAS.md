# Capstone Project: Tell Me a Story...#

Elyse Renouf   |   July 31, 2020   

Tell Me A Story (TMAS) is a content-based young children's book recommender using NLP that is derived from a Kaggle dataset of Goodreads.com book reviews. It was created so parents could input one of their child's favourite books and TMAS can recommend other similar books to read based entirely on key words in the book descriptions. 

**Please Note:** This is the first excerpt of notebooks 1 through 3, each of which were used to build the final product. This portion includes all the steps I took when downloading and paring down the initial suite of eleven Goodreads.com data files from Kaggle; I focused solely on children's books and resulting in a manageable starting point that is ready for cleaning and next steps.

### Loading & Merging Datasets ###

Because the original dataset did not classify books by genre or age, I attempted to identify books that are specifically for children by first researching whether the unique ISBN numbers that are allocated to each book would have a genre identifier but they do not. 

So instead, I decided to use page count as a rough identifier. I began by finding the average standard number of pages in children's books (according to authors and publishers), then pulled each of them out of the original Kaggle CSV files and merged them into a single dataset, specific to kids. 

Age Ranges & Book Classifications that I used for the purpose of this analysis:
<ul>
<li> Board Books (ages 0-2): 10 or less pages
<li> Picture Books (2-3): Pages in multiples of 8 ranging from 16-32 pages in length
<li> Early Readers (4-6): 32-48 pages (32+ for the purposes of this project)</ul>

And so, to simplify, I decided to split my data into only two categories using these age & book classifications as a guide (this step is done in notebook 2 of 3). 

In initially viewing the datasets and typical books/page counts, I started by only pulling in books over 50 pages but, after exporting those files to Excel just to scroll through the titles and do a contents check, I realized that the majority of that dataset was adult books using that page count. 

I tried again, using 40 pages as a threshold with similar results and upon closer review, I found that, in this dataset, anything over 38 pages is extremely difficult to capture and classify as a children's book by number of pages alone. 

I then had to isolate publisher names as a next step, however to reduce the number of publishers required for review, I limited my inital recommender dataset to target children under 6 years of age (according to publisher page count recommendations) and at a max of 38 pages. 

I understand I will be losing children's books that will be longer than 38 pages and will also capture some non-children's books in this initial sweep but this was the simplest way to start, in my opinion.  

This notebook includes the steps I took in pulling the eleven .csv files from Kaggle, each with over 100,000 entries and then pulling out only (mostly) children's books using the above guidelines and assumptions. 

I then merged those into a single file and exported my finished dataset to a .csv file to be read into my EDA & Cleaning notebook for the next steps in this project.

#### An additional page number discovery ####

After looking over the contents of the dataframe of books under 38 pages, I found that there were also a number of audiobooks, teachers guides and study guides that were present. These were items that were often between 1-6 pages. To eliminate the bulk of these without accidentally eliminating board books/sensory books targeted at infants, I opted to remove any books under 4 pages and then could filter out any others by removing any publisher names with the term "audio" in the name.

#then remove books with page counts less than 4 (cheat/sheets, coles notes, guides, etc.)

Looking at the available columns, and knowing that in order to make a book recommender work well, I will need to convert all my columns to numerical ones, I have opted to drop any column deemed unnecessary for my analysis and ultimately for my model. 

The columns I will drop include:
<ul>
    <li> ID: these are the original ID number from the various originally scraped datasets and not relevant
    <li> index: this was a previous index set prior to merging the originally scraped datasets
    <li> RatingDist1-5 & RatingDistTotal: these columns have a ratio of ratings distribution from the Kaggle analysis that are not relevant to the purpose of my project
    <li> Language: this column was almost entirely blank (90%) so deemed irrelevant so some Spanish, French, and other language books may be included in this dataframe. This dataset also includes many bilingual books, as parents often want to teach their kids multiple languages so I deemed any kids books, regardless of language, relevant but may need to screen these out at a later stage if it effects the performance of my recommender 
    <li> Count of text reviews: this column was included in the original dataset, though the actual text reviews were not. Because I am doing a content-based recommender, based on description, I decided to remove the text reviews counts to remove any confusion.
</ul>
<br>       
**Note:** Count of text reviews is different from CountsofReview which is a column to show how many numerical reviews each book has been given. I used this column to remove any books that had 0 reviews, with plans in future versions to potentially build out the recommender using user reviews. 

Other steps I took in preparing this data for cleaning:
<ul>
    <li> Removing any rows where CountsOfReview = 0
    <li> Replacing any columns where book description = blank with NaN (null value) and then removing all nulls in this column. The text recommender works entirely on this column so blanks are not ideal. If creating this recommender/ the data collection process from scratch, this would have been a mandatory field to have completed. 
    <li> Manually identifying children's publishers and creating a df that only included books with those publisher names (all variations) in the publisher column
    <li> Having this list of publisher names and all of the variations in those names found throughout the dataset allowed me to identify and create and apply a standard name for each publisher 
    <li> Exporing the this qualified dataset to .csv format in order to start with just a single csv file in my second notebook, dedicated to cleaning & exploring the data

Originally, I started removing publishers that clearly didn't have kids books in the current data. I began removing any publishers with "audio" in the name to remove the many many audiobooks, religions, university, adult content, and museum publications but, a quick export to Excel to really take a closer look at my data (using kidsbooks.to_csv('kidsbooks.csv', header=True), made me realize that it would be easier to make a list of publishers to keep and then cleaning/narrowing down that list to make sure my recommender is as robust as possible.
