Using business intelligence to solve challenges in operations has always been my bread and butter; now data science is my shiny new knife. 

As a recent data science bootcamp grad, I am making a shift away from management consulting in order to work with all that underlying data and be part of the team that really makes the magic happen: data science & analytics. 

I am currently seeking a remote data analyst role or one based near Victoria, BC which would allow me to marry my business background with my new coding skills and grow that into a long-term data analytics career.
